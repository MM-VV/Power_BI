# Data Jobs Dashboard 2.0

## Introduction

This Power BI dashboard was created to help job seekers analyze the data job market and understand salary trends, skill demand, and role distribution.

The dataset contains real-world 2024 data job postings, including job titles, salaries, locations, and required skills. This dashboard transforms that data into a single interactive page for efficient market analysis.
